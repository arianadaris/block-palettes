# block-palettes
This is a recreation of a Minecraft Block Palette generator website. *This website was not my original idea, and I do not take credit for it. This was heavily inspired by a pre-existing Block Palettes website.* This recreation allowed me to gain experience with NodeJS, Express, MongoDB and REST API.
